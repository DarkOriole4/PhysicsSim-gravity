# **PhysicsSim-gravity**   
This is an interactive gravity simulation built for Linux using C++ and OpenGL+GLFW. I originally wrote this for myself, but I've decided to publish it now. It can handle ~1000 particles without lag (at least on my machine)    
The repository includes a framework to build almost any time based animation using OpenGL.   

## **DEMO**   
[GravitySim_DEMO.webm](https://github.com/DarkOriole4/PhysicsSim-gravity/assets/105799574/4f4956cb-1376-46a0-8217-ad83f1786f85)

To experiment with it yourself, download the source files and compile them by typing `make` into the terminal while in the `/imgui/src` directory

## **Dependencies**   
install these by typing the following commands into your terminal   
`sudo apt update`

GLFW:    
`sudo apt-get install libglfw-dev` 

Make:
`sudo apt-get install make`

G++ compiler for linux
`sudo apt install build-essential`
