# **PhysicsSim-gravity**   
This is an interactive gravity simulation built for Linux using C++ and OpenGL+GLFW. I originally wrote this for myself, but I've decided to publish it now.   
The repository includes a framework to build almost any time based animation using OpenGL.

## **DEMO**

To experiment with it yourself, download the ./simulation file, and run it using the Linux Terminal
